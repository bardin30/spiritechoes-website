<strong>&quot;Light Ascending&#8230;Souls Rising&quot;</strong></font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
<br>
This acrylic painting evolved out of my desire to create a piece symbolic of 
New York City and the 9/11 tragedy... the many souls who were lost and the many 
prayers for the victims that went up that day from nations around the world.  
The buildings seemed better suited as cylinders, or vessels that held the souls 
of those who were affected the most that terrible day.  The water symbolizes the 
tears of so many, watching our televisions in horror as the towers disintegrated 
before our eyes.  As this painting evolved, the water became the sky and the 
vessels began to "float" above it all in a mystical way.  The spirit figures 
became dove-like as they ascended into the clouds... as if to say "peace."  The 
bright colors brought a paradoxical sense of joyfulness to the piece while 
the reflections in the water, a sense of serenity.  I place a fingerprint or 
a thumbprint somewhere in all my paintings when I have finished the final 
touches... but in this particular piece, each light in every tower is a fingerprint.  
I hope this unique painting brings you peace and serenity in the unpredictable world.

<strong>&quot;The Light Beyond the Gate&quot;</strong> </font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
<br>
As I created this acrylic painting, the colors and shapes evolved into 
a layered maze, reminding me of our lives and the many layers we have 
to peel back to find our true inner being.  The gate appeared quite 
magically, as did the spirit shapes beyond the gate... then came the portals 
of light coming through the layers and I understood what this painting 
was all about.  I lost my father on the first day of January 1999, but 
I feel his presence constantly.  I knew he was with me the day this 
piece was created.  I believe that souls of our loved ones stay with 
us throughout our lives... communicating in many ways... some of which are 
very obvious, some very subtle.  It is our task to stay open to that 
communication... to shut off the mind and listen with the heart.  I hope 
you have many hours of enjoyment and a sense of comfort from this acrylic painting.

<strong>&quot;One Light... Three Visions&quot;</strong>
</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<br>
<br>
After a twenty-five year sabbatical from painting, I picked up my brushes 
and began creating this, my first of many paintings to come.  As I painted, 
I was thinking about how many doors we have to open in order to find our 
one true light - our one truth - our purpose on the planet... that one thing 
that we alone are meant to do.  When we do find our light, it is perceived 
by others in many different ways, thus the three fold reflections of the 
light in the painting.  This acrylic painting, like all my others to follow, 
was not "planned" per se, but evolved out of a desire to capture on canvas 
the joy of painting with bright, undiluted color... the joy of rekindling my 
intense desire to create.  I hope you enjoy this acrylic painting as much 
as I enjoyed creating it.  You will find a thumbprint or fingerprint 
somewhere in the piece symbolizing my last and final "touch.
