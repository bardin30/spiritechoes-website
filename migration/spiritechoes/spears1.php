<br>
Somewhere in my mind is a place of total serenity. This is the place I go to seek 
refuge from the day to day worries and stress that sometimes occur... a place 
within my being where I know that all is well and all is in divine order. When 
I created this painting, it reminded me of the feeling I get when I go to that 
quiet place during meditation. The colors are always bright, but comforting, the 
feeling is always serene and relaxing.</font> </p>

<br>
I have a little pond in the back yard that gives me such joy. The murmur of the 
trickling fountain, the china-like beauty of the water lily when it looms... the 
shadows dancing across the lily pads. The life of the lily is so short, but so 
fragrant and wonderful... it seems I only get a glimpse of the majestic blooms 
before they are gone. As I painted this, I was reminded of how very precious every 
day is... how important it is to stop and appreciate the beauty of everything and 
everyone around us before they are gone. </font> </td>

<br>
When I created this piece, it was during a time of real conflict for organized 
religion. I wanted to portray the ongoing struggle between the spiritual beliefs 
of mankind... and yes, even man's struggle within himself to find his own spiritual 
path. Although unintentional on my part, the circular shape became a mandala, 
which then shadowed an eclipse, or void which may represent the moment when darkness 
and light, Good and Evil are separated in the world... marking the beginning of 
duality. The white flower in the mandala represents purity, and the calla lily 
specifically being womb-like, may signify a divine child or the Christ. Other 
religious symbols surfaced as I worked on the piece and of course, the playing 
cards, being unstable, fall as they may in a house of cards. I was reminded to 
go within to seek the truth that is my own and that we all have the answers we 
need if we just listen to our heart. </font> </td>

<br>
As I created this acrylic painting, it changed many times and continued to 
evolve until the very last brush stroke.  The thought in my mind as I painted 
it, was to portray the center of the universe, but it evolved into regions of 
the earth, primarily the Southwest and Colorado... places where I feel very "centered" 
and close to Spirit.  The dripping paint represents rain from the storm clouds above, 
which create the canyons and the mountains below... the White Sands evolve into aspen 
groves, the forests and then back into the icy mountain ranges.  The Hopi Native 
Americans tell a story about the emergence or spiral symbol.  The story goes that 
this is the third world to evolve from a spiral in space and that when people came 
out of the spiral, the last things out were our finger tips and toes, thus the 
spirals on our appendages to remind us where we came from.  The stairs are 
symbolic of our climb to find our "oneness" with our creator; the yellow is 
our light shining from deep within.  I hope your journey to find your center is a 
gentle one and that you receive much joy and contemplation from "Journey to the Center."
