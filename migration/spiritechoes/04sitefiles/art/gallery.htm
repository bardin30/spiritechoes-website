    face="Arial">Wolf Sittler began wood working over 33 years ago and now focuses on creating
    &quot;functional&quot; sculpture. By utilizing a blend of form, function, wood grain and
    color, Sittler takes his carefully selected wood and creates furniture that truly enhances
    the living and working environment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Working exclusively with native woods, from pine to maple burl, Wolf
    has had a special interest in wood chairs since 1987. Expounding on his process, Sittler
    states, &quot;Many believe that wood chairs cannot be comfortable but experience has
    taught me this is not so. By shaping the back and seat to conform to the natural body
    structure, a wooden chair can provide lasting comfort.&quot;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Over the years, Sittler's work has evolved from simple linear shapes
    and angular patterns to a current emphasis on curves and sculptural forms. His products
    include desks, game tables, sofa tables, chairs of all kinds, dressers, clocks and other
    custom designed work. Truly unique, his functional furnishings are indeed sculptural and
    are meant to be viewed, used,. . .and caressed.</font></td>

    talent and archeological interests to create a unique look into Native American
    pre-history.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Peel enjoys portraying scenes of the ancient Americans' every day
    life as well as classical interpretations of their rock art. The scenes, created from the
    artist's imagination, are based on careful research of archeological data, the writings of
    early Spanish explorers, and written information on the cultures existing today.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Working in the ancient Native American shelters of the lower Pecos
    Region, Reeda Peel meticulously draws her interpretation of the painted images before her
    on the rock walls, contemplating their meaning. Visions come to her from her travels to
    the lower Pecos Region of South Texas and through hiking expeditions. &quot;Sun
    Signs&quot; pictured is an interpretation of Apache rock art from the E1 Paso region.</font></td>

    piece of vintage glass, a label from an Oriental shipment of goods, or a piece of tissue
    from a local department store. Creating beauty from mundane materials becomes a challenge
    and delight for Annis as she layers her &quot;treasures' into a one-of-a-kind works of
    lasting beauty.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">An artist for 25 years, Ms. Allen lived and worked in the Caribbean
    and the northeast before returning to native Texas in 1980. She now resides in Austin with
    her husband, artist R.T. Allen. A hearty congratulations to this couple who has just
    celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary this past year !</font></p>

    <p><font face="Arial">Caroselli began her oil painting career in 1972 after her family
    moved to Texas.&nbsp; Before long Mary was approached by the prestigious card company,
    Leanin' Tree, to reproduce her work on cards, posters and other gift items.&nbsp; Calendar
    companies began to call to inquire about placing her work on their products, and soon
    Marianne's career was taking off.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial">Multi - talented Caroselli began to sculpt in 1979.
    &nbsp; Professional classes soon followed at the Cowboy Artists of America Museum in
    Kerrville.&nbsp; Today, Marianne's sculptures range from table size to life size images of
    children, cowboys, Native Americans, horses and wildlife, just to name a few.&nbsp; Her
    work can be found in many corporate collections as well as the private collections of Burt
    Reynolds, Daniel Stern, Wayne Newton and Byron Nelson.</font></p>
