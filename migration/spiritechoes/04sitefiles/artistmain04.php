      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Spirit Echoes Fine Art 
        Festival is proud to present Dale Lewis of Oneonta, Alabama as the 2004 
        Showcase Artist. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dale works alone in his studio 
        creating unique pieces inspired by visual stimuli or images drawn from 
        his personal experiences. His work is based around exceptional pieces 
        of wood. Often whimsical, the playful nature if each piece is often emphasized 
        by bright colors and exaggerated features which are refined to a state 
        of elegance.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each piece is constructed by 
        methods common to typical furniture construction: mortise and tenon, dovetails, 
        and lap joints. He also uses screws, bolts, and brackets to make the pieces 
        stronger and more functional. The shaping and carving that characterizes 
        his work is done with power saws, grinders, sanders and carvers. Refining 
        is accomplished with manual tools and meticulous handwork. </font>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dale has exhibited across the 
        United States and has been featured in many prestigious shows including 
        but not limited to: the Montgomery, Huntsville, Columbus, and Mobile Museums 
        of Fine Art, the James A. Renwick Alliance Craft Auction in Washington, 
        D.C., the Tennessee Valley Art Association Solo Exhibit, and the Kentuck 
        Festival. His awards and publications are extensive and too numerous to 
        list. We truly appreciate his participation in the Spirit Echoes first 
        annual fine art festival and are delighted to share his work with you.
